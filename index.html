        <p class="description">
          Virat Kohli is an Indian cricketer, rated as one of the best batsmen
          across all the cricket formats. Considered as a fierce competitor, he
          occasionally performs as a right-arm medium pace bowler. He is known
          for his dependable and powerful batting style and has single-handedly
          won several matches for India.

            In October, 13-year-old Virat is called up to the Delhi Under-15
            team for the Polly Umrigar Trophy. He finishes the season as Delhi’s
            top scorer.

            After impressing at the youth level for Delhi, Virat is selected for
            the India Under-19 team for the first time and has a glorious tour
            of England, averaging over a hundred in the one-day series.

            Virat captained India to victory in the Under-19 World Cup in
            Malaysia, finishing the tournament as one of the top three
            run-getters. His natural leadership skills caught the attention of

            Virat played every single match of India’s successful 2011 World Cup
            campaign, making his only century in the first game of the
            tournament against Bangladesh. Though he didn’t really light up the
            tournament with his bat, his quote about Sachin at the end of the
            tournament has gone down in cricketing folklore: “Sachin Tendulkar
            has carried the burden of the nation for 21 years. It is time we
            carried him on our shoulders.”

            Kohli scored his first test hundred in rather spectacular
            circumstances in the fourth and final test against Australia at
            Adelaide, narrowly surviving getting run out when batting with
            Ishant Sharma, almost running out of partners as well. His effort
            though failed to save India. We lost the series 4-0.

            Virat was named stand-in ODI skipper for an injured MS Dhoni when
            India toured the West Indies; earlier that year, he had also been
            appointed captain of his IPL franchise, the Royal Challengers

            Kohli got his first taste of Test captaincy when he was once again

            He played what was easily the best innings of his burgeoning career
            as India beat Australia in Mohali to advance to the semi-finals of
            the ICC World T20. His 82 off 51 balls was a classy effort, etched
            with timing and precision as opposed to the lappa style of cricket
            one usually associates with 20 over cricket.
